i show it to the manager 
i show it to the manager 
when the bill come , nothing be comp , so i tell the manager very politely that we be willing to pay for the wine , but i do not think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . 
the manager finally say he would comp the two glass of wine -lrb- which cost less than the food -rrb- 
we pay and leave because we do not feel like argue any more . 
and there be no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food 
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that be usually so packed 
there be no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service 
unhygienic 
i do not recommend .

the waitress come over and ask we if everything be okay 
but the spinach be so undercooked that i just could not bite through it 
i could not even enjoy the mashed potato because it be hide completely under the chicken and spinach . 
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it be completely inedible . 
guess what , i wait for twenty minute before she come over and when she finally do , she say , `` oh well , i wish you would have say something earlier '' no apology , nothing . 
after that she simply take we plate , walk away , come back another twenty minute later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!! 
no desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!!

so , if you be walk by and think about dining , you might want to see who be go to be seat you first ...

a word to the wise : you can not dine here and disturb the maitre-d 's sense of '' table turnover '' 
if you go here , do it on he off-night .

i be shock that my friend want to stay after the waitress say 
the three of we stand in front of she should have be a indication of how many of we there be . 
we do not look like the other patron in there so unfortunately i think that may have be part of the problem . 
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non 
existent customer service

the waiter deliver we 
i can not believe that it be , but please put the bag down before deliver food ! 
the waitress come to check in on we every few minute 
i could not ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friend , who be in mid bite , to clear the table . 
she then put the check down without ask if we be do , and come to check on the bill every two minute , even though we be one of three occupy table . 
i wish i could like this place more 
and i wish someone would retrain the staff
