Love Al Di La 
I recommend this place to everyone . 
Great food . 
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn . 
The pastas are incredible , the risottos -LRB- particularly the sepia -RRB- are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing . 
Overpriced and not tasty

Run do n't walk . 
Super YUMMY Pizza ! 
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant . 
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas ! 
We had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza ! 
We had fun eating in there , we were there like around 3 a.m. in the morning ! 
Will comeback for sure , wish they have it here in LA. . . 
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .

I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed . 
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly . 
The potato balls were not dry at all ... in fact it was buttery . 
The only downside ... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time . 
I 'll be back for sure .

quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri . 
A weakness is the chicken in the salads . 
It 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it . 
Also , I personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .

Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing ! 
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York . 
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house -LRB- even the gyro meat and sausages -RRB- , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . 
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .

Every time I have a special occasion with my boyfriend I have a hard time going anywhere else . 
It is so romantic . 
Its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go . 
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like ` that ' couple . 
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together . 
I 've enjoyed 99 % of the dishes we 've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish -LRB- I 'm a daring eater but not THAT daring -RRB- . 
Once you try it for a special occasion beware . . you ca n't stop ! 
You 'll be ther for every anniversary , birthday , valentines day ...

The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average . 
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . 
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts -LRB- but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for -RRB- . 
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . 
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine -LRB- which cost less than the food -RRB- , and made it seem like a big concession . 
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more . 
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . 
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers . 
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors . 
If you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing .

Still we keep going back : -RRB- 
I was speechless by the horrible food .

We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka . 
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . 
We asked for beverages and never received them . 
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .

The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! 
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .

Do n't go with a larger group than 4 ! 
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us . 
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . 
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment . 
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma . 
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion -LRB- maybe 3 of each -RRB- .

She replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . '' 
The food arrived in about 15 minutes . 
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good . 
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !

Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .

For starters they delivered us someone else 's order . 
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , -LRB- sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option -RRB- , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . 
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

None was made so i hung up . 
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . 
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

More Williamsburg Garbage 
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . 
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling . 
Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . 
The nakgi-bokum was horrible . 
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted . 
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . 
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .

She just nodded and walked off . 
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . 
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . 
We were charged full price . 
Lives up to the hype 
We 've tried before but it always packed and does n't take reservations . 
It was well worth the wait . 
The wife had the risotto which was amazing . 
It does n't look appetizing as it 's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .

Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go . 
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza . 
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components . 
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .

The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night . 
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing !! 
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating . 
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !

Dumbfoundingly Poor 
This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . 
Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn . 
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . 
Polite acknowledgement is out ; 
supercilious scorn is in . 
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? 
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer -LRB- which was delicious -RRB- .

At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . 
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . 
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . 
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . 
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier '' No apology , nothing . 
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it !!!!!!!!!!!! 
No desert menu , no apology , nothing !!!!!! 
This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it . 
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing !!!! 
The level of rudeness was preposterous .

The frizzy retro girl -LRB- with winged / Dame Edna glasses -RRB- will yell at you if you try to order a drink . 
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she `` had a BBQ to go to '' that night - WTF ??

There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . 
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . 
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . 
A word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-D 's sense of '' table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else . 
If you go here , do it on his off-night . 
Best meal in a long time ! 
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening .

Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner . 
Appetizers took nearly an hour . 
When the main course finally arrived -LRB- another 45mins -RRB- half of our order was missing . 
Never got an explanation as to what was going on . 
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .

I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane . 
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can I help you '' and `` how many are in your party . '' 
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were . 
We did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .

But the service is HORRID ! 
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . 
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . 
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! 
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating -LRB- a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it -RRB- . 
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . 
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . 
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .
