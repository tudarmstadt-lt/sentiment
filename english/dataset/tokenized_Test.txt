But here 's something I had n't realized before buying it : there is n't an optical drive , which means NO CDs or DVDs ! 
This product was DOA . 
Fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test . 
Would not recommend . 
Pretty good laptop . 
Good for basic stuff . 
Do n't try to use to play any pc games or anything . 
Just for simple web browsing and media streaming .

My mistake was to not research this one , no DVD and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures .

the only drawback is no DVD player . . but for $ 20 you can buy an external one 
Very light and beautiful . 
It 's just a little slow . 
five starts 
Terribly slow ... 
Start up time took forever everything runs very slowly .

Been using Lenovo ThinkPad Edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them . 
They have held up well not just in our sales department , but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust , exhaust , grease , oil , and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances .

I bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser . 
There is a chance mine is defective but regardless I 'm not going to try another one this is a terrible product . 
I 'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014 .

This is going to be random and unorganized , but here are my thoughts on the laptop : So far so good after a month . 
It took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1 , after being an XP user for many years . 
Everything seems to be running smoothly . 
Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software .

If you 're the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office , this is the laptop for you . 
Do n't expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you .

Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience .

Now I 'm looking into the return process , which I 'm sure will just be loads of fun , if my prior experience is any indication . 
Seriously , save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company .

My only concern is that since the battery is not external , I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time . 
I wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol .

That 's a nuisance for family Skype calls ... only one can speak at a time . 
We have n't used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars , but so far it has been a very good laptop . 
Several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why -- this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we 've ever owned . 
I 'm a life-long desktop computer user , and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a `` normal '' keyboard as I 've ever seen .

My final thoughts : if you are a Mac user , stay away . 
If you want to travel with this laptop , do n't buy it .

It is quite impressive at multitasking , which really surprised me . 
I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well . 
BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen , it 's certainly good enough for the average person , but if you 're used to good screens this may bother you a bit , but it 's certainly not unbearable by anyone 's standards . 
If you want to game , this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings , but I certainly would n't recommend it for gaming . 
Overall , a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing . 
Would definitely recommend for those who are `` technologically ignorant '' 
this computer is very slow

I have no idea what 's taking up all the room , it does n't make sense .

The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon . 
Firstly , it has no leds to let you know what is going on , no cap lock , no hard drive indicator , nothing . 
Ok , one light to let you know if the damn thing is on . 
The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it , even when the strength bar is filled . 
Also , when you try to download a large file , like a video , it will start out normally , downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec , making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless .

The computer is as expected , and worth the money . 
The 8.1 windows is a major disappointment . 
Operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain ! 
It came with no instruction book - no back up CD 's and has already crashed .

I am really not happy with this computer ... 
I do n't like WINDOWS 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar .

The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light - makes it really portable . . this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus .

Now the graphics are not HD ... and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic -LRB- medium low grade -RRB- plastic .

So if you do n't have kids , or not in high school or do n't accidently sit on it , it should be fine . 
Now the speed is disappointing . 
Start up is fine maybe 20 secs at most , but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times . 
Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open .

Windows 8.1 has its pros and cons . 
The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on .

I was nervous at first that I purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight . 
Of course this will decrease your battery life . 
The sound is very nice and crisp . 
Also , I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast .
